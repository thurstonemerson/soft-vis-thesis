Evaluation using eye-tracking technology to establish possible performance gains in the established software engineering task-set using a tag cloud metaphor.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Define tasks from the appropriate task-set outlined in section 1.
	\item Using research from section 2, identify base-line visualisations that are appropriate to compare with tag clouds using this task-set.
	\item Experimental data to be provided from the research on software data-sets in section 2.
\end{itemize}
