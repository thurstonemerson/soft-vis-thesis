\begin{itemize}
	\item Drawing on the research from section 1, establish task-set areas where evidence shows tag clouds are most useful (e.g. overview/gisting) and discuss where this might be applicable in software engineering. 
	\item Data source – define where the static data will be collected from (section 2).
	\item Mappings – discuss the dimensions that will be mapped to each tag cloud attribute, as set out in section 1.
	\item Address the challenges of visualising software data with the particular characteristics as defined in section 2 (e.g. skewed distributions, outliers etc.).
