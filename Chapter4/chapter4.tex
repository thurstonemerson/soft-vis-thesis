Chapter 1 has provided information on the kinds of tasks tag clouds have been shown to be useful for, as well as identifying factors that must be considered when designing a visualisation. Chapter 2 has discussed process and techniques for visualising software quality and built up a picture of a typical software data-set. Building on the work from both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, design a tag cloud visualisation that will map visual attributes to data dimensions, ensuring defined high level user needs are met. Using eye-tracking technology, evaluate the implementation by comparing it to current techniques used in software and multi-variate data visualisation.
