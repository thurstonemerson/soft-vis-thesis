## Tag Clouds in Software Visualisation

Developing and maintaining software is a difficult task, and finding effective
methods of understanding software is more necessary now than
ever with the last few decades seeing a dramatic climb in the scale of
software. Appropriate visualisations may enable greater understanding
of the datasets we deal with in software engineering. As an aid
for sense-making, visualisation is widely used in daily life (through
graphics such as weather maps and road signs), as well as in other
research domains, and is thought to be exceedingly beneficial. Unfortunately,
there has not been widespread use of the multitude of
techniques which have proposed for the software engineering domain.

Tag clouds are a simple, text-based visualisation commonly found
on the internet. Typically, implementations of tag clouds have not
included rich interactive features which are necessary for data exploration.
In this thesis, I introduce design considerations and a
task set for enabling interaction in a tag cloud visualisation system.
These considerations are based on an analysis of challenges in visualising
software engineering data, and the perceptive inuences of visual
properties available in tag clouds.

The design and implementation of interactive system Taggle based on
these considerations is also presented, along with its broad-based evaluation.
Evaluation approaches were informed by a systematic mapping
study of previous tag cloud evaluation, providing an overview of
existing research in the domain. The design of Taggle was improved
following a heuristic evaluation by domain experts. Subsequent evaluations
were divided into two parts - experiments focused on the tag
cloud visualisation technique itself, and a task-based approach focused
on the whole interactive system. As evidenced in the series of evaluative
studies, the enhanced tag cloud features incorporated into Taggle
enabled faster visual search response time, and the system could be
used with minimal training to discover relevant information about an
unknown software engineering dataset.
