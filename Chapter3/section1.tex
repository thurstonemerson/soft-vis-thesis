\begin{itemize}
	\item Define software quality â€“ it  means different things to different people. From a user perspective we want to know - is this software of value to me (speed, failure rate)? From a business perspective we want to know questions such as - is this architecture suitable? Is this software understandable and therefore easy to maintain? How easy is it to build new functionality?
	\item Discuss the different types of quality views we can have - big picture or overview: architecture diagrams, detailed view: code review, somewhere in the middle: visualising data and metrics.
	\item Commonly used metrics e.g. size, complexity, process etc.
\end{itemize}
