In information visualisation research, there have been various attempts to extend and modify the tag cloud metaphor for novel purposes \citep[such as][]{Candan08, Cui10, dicaro08, lee10} . However, it is not clear what gains application of tag clouds can reasonably achieve without a thorough understanding of the factors which influence user perception and a clearly defined knowledge of the kinds of tasks where tag clouds are shown to be high-performing. This chapter seeks to set out the current knowledge surrounding the usage of tag clouds, identifying areas which are either unknown or where weak evidence has been provided. These areas are then clarified with eye-tracking experiments.
