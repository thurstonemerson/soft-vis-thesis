Setting out a (generally accepted) set of tasks that tag clouds support. (Rivadeneira et al).

\begin{itemize}
	\item Searching: Locating a specific data element.
	\item Browsing: Information searching with no specific target item in mind.
	\item Overview/Gisting: Forming a general impression of the underlying dataset.
	\item Recognition/matching: recognising which of several sets of information a tag cloud is likely to represent.
\end{itemize}

Reviewing literature evaluating tag cloud performance in the area of tag clouds from a task perspective and identifying gaps in the knowledge or where there exists a lack of hard evidence.

\subsection{Searching}

Research supporting premise that tag clouds provide sub-optimal support for search tasks
- Oosterman and Cockburn (2010), tables faster and more accurate than tag clouds
- Halvey and Keane (2007), lists perform better than tag clouds
- Kuo et al (2007), lists more helpful and faster than tag clouds
- Sinclair and Cardew-Hall (2008), users prefer traditional search interface

Research supporting premise that tag clouds provide support for search tasks
- Kuo et al (2007), reported user satisfaction higher with tag clouds than with lists

\subsection{Browsing}

Research supporting premise that tag clouds provide support for browsing tasks
- Sinclair and Cardew-Hall (2008), users prefer a tag cloud over a traditional search interface

\subsection{Gisting}

Research supporting premise that tag clouds provide sub-optimal support for gisting
-  Rivadeneira et al (2007), lists may provide a more accurate impression than tag clouds

Research supporting premise that tag clouds provide support for gisting
- Kuo et al (2007), tag clouds provide improvements for summarising descriptive information
