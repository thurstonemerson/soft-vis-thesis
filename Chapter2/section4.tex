\begin{itemize}
	\item Completeness: representing all the semantic contents of the data to be displayed.
	\item Spatial organisation: Overall layout. How easy it is to retrieve information and be aware of overall distribution of data.
	\item Information coding: additional characteristics used to aid user perception.
